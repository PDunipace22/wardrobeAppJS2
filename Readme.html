<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
<p>
Although you will not be directed to specific content on which to apply the following JavaScript, you MUST provide detailed documentation on the script you used and the locations it was used.</p>
<p>
You MUST utilize JavaScript methods to accomplish the following tasks:
</p>
<ul><li>
The website MUST allow the user to dynamically add content in your web application utilizing a JavaScript method, buttons and text fields
<p><b>I accomplished this by creating a prompt box and method that causes the box to pop up when the page is loaded that has the user enter their name and then has the name of the closet include the their name in the title.</b></p>
</li><li>
The website MUST allow the user to dynamically remove content from your web application utilizing a JavaScript method, buttons and text fields
<p><b>I accomplished this by creating a modal that pops up when the screen is loaded and can be closed by the user.</b></p>
</li><li>
The website MUST allow the user to dynamically show all clothing items that meet certain criteria (for example, are of a certain color or are a certain type, like jeans or tshirts) utilizing a JavaScript method, buttons and text fields
<p><b>I accomplished this by creating a filter with buttons and an input box allowing the user to choose by color, type, season or occasion.</b></p>
</li><li>
The website MUST allow the user to dynamically enhance size and color of text on mouseover utilizing a JavaScript method, buttons and text fields
<p><b>I accomplished this by creating a function that changes the color and enlarges the text when using the onmouseover event.</b></p>
</li><li>
The text MUST return to its default size and color when a mouseover is not being performed.
<p><b>I accomplished this by creating a function for when the button or words are not moused over that they go back to their initial size and color.</b></p>
</li><li>
The website MUST allow the user to navigate to another site utilizing a JavaScript method, buttons and text fields.
<p><b>I accomplished this by creating a button that uses a function to activate a confirm box allowing the user to chose if they want to go to the linked page.</b></p>
</li><li>
The website MUST inform the user they are being directed to another site.
<p><b>I accomplished this by creating a confirm box that alerts the user that they are about to leave that page.
</li><li>
The website MUST allow the user to cancel the action before it is performed.
<p><b>I accomplished this by having the user click on either the ok or cancel button in the confirm box.</b></p>
</li><li>
If the user affirms the action, the website must open in another browser tab.
<p><b>I accomplished this by using the phrase windows.open and then included the link and then the '_blank' command to open in a new tab.</b></p>
</li><li>
Add a copyright with date in the footer of your website.
<p><b>I accomplished this by using the onmouseover and onmouseout events after creating two functions. One that occurs when the footer is hovered over and the other after the footer is no longer hovered over.</b></p>
</li><li>
The website MUST dynamically replace the copyright and date text to "created by "Insert Your Name".
<p><b>I accomplished this by ....</b></p>
</li><li>
You can choose to perform this action onhover or onclick.
<p><b>I accomplished this by having the footer change when the cursor is hovering over it.</b></p>
</li><li>
The website MUST implement an array utilizing JavaScript.
<p><b>I accomplished this by using the for loops to iterate through each of the items to see if they match the array.</b></p>
</li><li>
The website MUST provide feedback to the user based on the contents of the array.
<p><b>I accomplished this by having the each of the filter options show only those items that fit in the array.</b></p>
</li><li>
The website must include your homework example JavaScript.
<p><b>I accomplished this by adding a function that will alert the user to when one of the fields on the edit page has been changed.</b></p>
</li><li>
Include a file called README that describes the project, possibly using this rubric as your starting point. State on your README the ways in which you fulfilled the requirements above. This will not be opened as a view (although you may want to save it as an HTML file), we will simply be reading the code itself to see how you fulfilled the requirements.
